While many people unfamiliar with [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) consider it to just be 2-D Minecraft, there is so much more to it than that.

Terraria features a progression system that offers hours of content, more than a dozen bosses, and hundreds of weapons.

There are four fully fleshed-out combat classes, and tons of accessories to boost offense, defense, and mobility.

Besides combat, there are many biomes to explore, almost 200 block types to build with, and countless crafting recipes.

Whether you’re a fighter, builder, adventurer, or explorer, Terraria offers something for everyone. The single-player experience provides endless entertainment.

<img class="lazyload" alt="Terraria" data-src="/img/game-hosts/terraria/terraria.jpg">

However, where Terraria really shines is in its multiplayer experience. There’s nothing better than conquering a new world with friends.

Of course, in order to play with your friends, you’ll need a server. You can always just join a server, but that would leave you at the mercy of another’s rules.

Terraria offers an in-game feature called “Host and Play”, allowing you to invite Steam friends to play on your world. This mode has its own drawbacks though, as the session ends for everyone as soon as you leave the game, and it can be prone to lag.

For complete creative freedom and a 24-7 gaming experience, you will need to set-up your own server. There are two ways to go about this: [renting a server](/game-hosts/), or hosting your own.

Both options have their own advantages and disadvantages. The next section will cover these choices so you can decide which best meets your goal.

## Renting a Terraria Server vs Hosting Your Own

Depending on how you plan to use the server and your goals, you may find that one of these options works better for you. There is no one best solution, but renting and hosting both offer a variety of features with their own upsides and downsides.

<img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="server" data-src="/img/game-hosts/terraria/server.jpg">

### Advantages of Renting

A rented server is online 24/7 with no input required from you. Once it’s set up, there’s no need to keep your computer on or monitor it.

The server provider will usually also take care of all maintenance and security issues, meaning you don’t have to worry about backing up any files or issues like DDoS attacks.

### Disadvantages of Renting

Of course, renting a server will incur a monthly cost. This cost will increase with the number of players you have and additional features.

The other downside of renting is that you don’t have total control of the server. You may not be able to customize every single aspect and feature of a rented server.

### Advantages of Hosting Your Own

<img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="pc" data-src="/img/game-hosts/terraria/pc.jpg">

The first and most obvious advantage of hosting your own server is that it’s free! You won’t have to pay a cent in order to host a server.

Besides this, you have total control of the server. You can access all the files and configure the server however you like, with no limitations.

If you are tech-savvy, the opportunity to mess around and configure the server could be a great learning opportunity.

Additionally, most modern computers come with at least 4 GB of RAM, and many have 8-16 or more. Because of Terraria’s low resource requirements, almost any computer should be able to handle a large server with many people easily.

### Disadvantages of Hosting Your Own

In order to host your own server, your computer has to be on. This means either keeping your computer on 24/7 or having periods when the server is down if your computer is off.

In addition to shortening the life of your computer, you will have to pay increased electricity costs to keep it always on.

Maintenance is another thing to consider. If you’re hosting a server, you’ll have to keep up on a number of tasks like server backups, game updates, etc. You might consider all the extra work a hassle.

Lastly, security is an issue you might be concerned about. Opening a port on your computer could create a vulnerability for your router. Internet security is a complex issue, especially if you’re not very familiar with it.

## Free Terraria Server Hosting

If after considering the options you decide to host your own server, then fear not! The set-up process is relatively easy and painless, even though creating a server might sound intimidating.

This section will give you a quick rundown about what steps to take in order to host your own server, but we also have a more in-depth guide.

The first step is to find your Terraria installation folder.

The default installation path is **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria**.

Next, open TerrariaServer.exe to bring up the command prompt. You might want to make a desktop shortcut as you’ll be accessing this frequently.

<img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="Command Prompt" data-src="/img/game-hosts/terraria/cmd-prompt.png">

The prompt will display a list of available worlds, with the option to create a new one. If you’re creating a new world, it will ask you to select the world size and other parameters.

Once you have created a world, or chosen an existing one, it will present a number of options. You can change the number of players, the port, [port forwarding](https://whatismyipaddress.com/port-forwarding) (required if other players are on a different network), and the password.

After this, the world will be open and you and your friends can join by going to the multiplayer section of Terraria and selecting the “Join via IP” option.

Keep in mind that you’ll have to keep your computer on and TerrariaServer.exe running to keep the server up.

## Things to Note About Terraria Hosting Providers

Depending on the hosting provider you choose, you may find that they offer different services and features for different prices.

Of course, more features will cost more money, but you may find the increased cost worth it depending on what goals you have for your server.

The first thing to look at is available slots/players. Most providers increase price linearly with each additional slot, though some may offer bulk discounts.

Some providers will cover more games than others. For example, Gameserverkings covers popular games like [Rust](/game-hosts/rust/) and Terraria, but lacks on the smaller titles.

Another important characteristic to consider is server locations. If you and your friends/other players are located far from the server, you can expect a higher ping and a bit of lag.

The amount of memory is an additional quality to look at. For more information, you can refer to the section on RAM below.

Besides hardware features, you may find yourself wanting maintenance features. Many providers include free server back-ups, or offer to set up server plug-ins.

[DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) is an important security feature to look for. You could also look for dedicated IP options, as well as automatic game updates.

Hosting providers offer a multitude of features for different prices, and your needs are likely to vary based on your budget and goals.

The previous features apply to any game server you might rent, but there are also a couple features specific to Terraria.

For instance, if you’re looking to add mods, you’ll need a server that supports it.

Some servers offer TShock support, which allow you to add plug-ins and mods to your server.

## How Much Does a Terraria Server Cost?

Once again, Terraria server costs can vary greatly depending on your needs.

For a simple server with about 6-8 people, you may be able to find a host for as low as $5 a month.

A massive server with a couple hundred players can easily go for over $100 per month.

Having mods or plug-ins installed for you might incur a one-time cost of about $10-20.

Upgrading the CPU, RAM, and hard drive of the server will also drive up monthly costs. Other features like DDoS protection and back-ups might be offered for free, but they could also end up costing more depending on the provider.

## How Much RAM Does a Terraria Server Need?

One of the great things about Terraria is that it’s not a very resource heavy game at all. The 2-D nature of the game and pixel art style graphics don’t require beefy hardware, unlike modern AAA titles with power-hungry 3-D graphics.

This means that players with older and weaker computers can still get by without much trouble. In fact, Terraria should run relatively fine on even a laptop with integrated graphics.

Thankfully, this also translates to server hosting. [RAM](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-ram/) requirements are generally pretty low for Terraria servers.

A small world with just a couple players should have at least 1 GB of RAM. A large world with about a dozen players may require 2 GB. Beyond this, 4-8 GB of RAM should be enough to handle almost anything you want, including many players and mods.

## Conclusion

With so many features, Terraria is a great game to play on your own. Nonetheless, it’s at its best when you’re exploring, fighting, and building with your friends.

Fortunately, there are plenty of options if you want to take your game to the next level. The simplest option is the Steam “Host and Play” feature, but that comes with its own problems.

If you’re somewhat tech-savvy, you may prefer to set-up and host your own server. This is a great option if you have a computer to spare and want to game with your friends.

Overall though, the most versatile choice is to RENT A SERVER. Hosting providers have options for small servers with friends all the way up to massive online worlds.

The numerous features also allow you a ton of flexibility. Adding mod support, world back-ups, game updates, and DDoS protection gives you a safe and secure server that requires no maintenance or managing.

And the less time you spend managing a server, the more time you can spend exploring the world of Terraria with friends.
