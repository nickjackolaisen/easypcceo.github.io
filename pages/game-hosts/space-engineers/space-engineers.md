Here's the deal:

Space is big, and better explored with friends.

Space Engineers has a built-in multiplayer mode for co-op, but it only works when the host is online.

What if you want to game when your buddies can't?

Enter Space Engineers hosting.

In this article, we're taking a look at the best Space Engineers hosting companies on the market.

## About Space Engineers

<img class="lazyload" alt="space engineers gameplay" data-src="/img/game-hosts/space-engineers/game.jpg">
 
In the words of the devs themselves, "Space Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration."

Like other sandbox games such as [Garry's Mod](/game-hosts/gmod/), Space engineers strives to provide a stimulating building experience with realistic physics on its volumetric-based physics engine. You can interact with everything, build, and destroy anything your heart desires.

Following its release on Steam Early Access in 2013, Space Engineers has garnered more than 3 million copies sold and has won many indie game awards during its lifetime.

It's a weird thought, the sheer numbers it reached from release to now, and it didn't even exit Early Access until 2019!

## How We Picked

As for the server hosting list, we picked servers based around the same metric we use for all of our server lists.

We compared the total speeds of each host, their pricing, and the features that each host provides to customers. One host may be cheaper, but another may be easier to use, for example. Support is also a huge one for us, as is mod support.

## Top Space Engineers Hosting Providers

{% include gtx-gaming.html %}

Our top pick for Space Engineers server hosts had to go to [GTX Gaming](https://www.gtxgaming.co.uk/clientarea/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=1){: target="\_blank"}, no doubt.

GTX Gaming has Space Engineers with a minimum of ten slots and a maximum of 60 slots, coming in at $0.75 per slot. They offer up to 5GB of memory for free, but after that, you have to pay. If your world is huge (as most are in Space Engineers) you may need to pay extra.

They offer the best all-around server package alongside a wide array of configuration options for you to deck out your server with whatever power it might need. Plus, they're one of the most affordable hosts you can buy, believe it or not.

Additionally, no matter where you are, they've got a location closeby, ensuring optimal performance. We should note, however, that servers based in Stockholm, Sweden, and Sao Paulo, Brazil cost an extra $10 and $19, respectively.

</div>

{% include citadel-servers.html %}

Citadel Servers is another great game hosting company, especially for Space Engineers server hosting.

Their Space Engineers servers start at $0.87/slot with a minimum of 10 slots per month, and a maximum of 64 slots per month.

Citadel Servers' nodes can be found all over the world, so you probably live near one (which is important, unless you want to lag like crazy!)

Their price per slot is slightly higher than Host Havoc ($0.75/slot) but they have a lower minimum slot count, which means their minimum monthly payment is also lower.

If you just want to host a small, private Space Engineers server for you and some friends, Citadel Servers makes the most sense. On the other hand, if you want a large server, Host Havoc or GTX Gaming is probably the best option.

For the budgeters out there, we couldn't just leave out our favorite budget pick: [Host Havoc](https://hosthavoc.com/billing/aff.php?affse=1379){: target=" \_blank"}.

Now, while Host Havoc does offer the lowest per-slot price, it may not be as good as some of our top picks if you're only planning on hosting a small number of players because the minimum slot count is 15, so just make sure you're picking a host that'll get you your money's worth.

Host Havoc has a tiered pricing system for their Space Engineers servers. They start at fifteen slots, for $0.75 a slot. But as you increase the slot count, the price per slot decreases, which incentivizes larger servers.

If you want to run a big Space Engineers server, Host Havoc is probably your best bet.

As for what else Host Havoc offers, the configuration is just as simple as GamerServers except for an added CPU priority option. Though, when you get into the server menu after purchase, Host Havoc has one of the best server dashboards out there.

You can even try out Host Havocs features before committing with their 72-hour Risk-Free Money Back Guarantee.

## Space Engineers Server Hosting Xbox

At this time, there is no available server hosting for Space Engineers on Xbox and no recent news regarding it.

## Space Engineers Server Manager

The Server Manager application has worked perfectly in many popular games recently, and Space Engineers is one of those.

This program allows you to, well, easily manage your dedicated server with a simple to navigate interface. Offering ease of use binds like auto-updating, auto-restart, bandwidth monitor, times backups, and so much more.

If you're interested in downloading it, [click here](https://www.jimbobslimbob.com/filescat.asp?cat1=Programs&cat2=Utilities){: target="\_blank"}.

## Space Engineers Server Settings

Before you start playing on your new Space Engineers Server, you should take a couple of minutes to go through the [server settings](https://help.serverblend.com/en/article/dos-and-donts-with-your-space-engineers-game-server-16tq09g/){: target="\_blank"} and configure some stuff.

First of all, setting a world size border limit is a must to either keep the game interesting with a massive world or reduce the required storage space with a small world. We suggest setting it to 2000.

Cleanup the server while the server is off, as to avoid any glitching or lost data. Never delete files while the server is running.

Never delete the SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg file.

I don't want to write a novel about Space Engineers server settings, but you get the idea.

## Space Engineers Modding

<img class="lazyload" alt="space engineers server mods" data-src="/img/game-hosts/space-engineers/mods.jpg">

As with all great sandbox games, Space Engineers has a wide array of [mods](https://www.thegamer.com/best-space-engineers-mods/){: target="\_blank"} you may add to your game to improve performance, gameplay, or just add some stupid stuff for fun.

The Space Engineers dev team supports modding and has even supplied a modding API that allows any mod creators to more efficiently and directly work with the game's code.

They've also provided the ModSDK application, which offers tools to creators to streamline the modding process.

Amazing!

### Surface Occupation

The [Surface Occupation mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1135484957){: target="\_blank"} attempts to alleviate the emptiness of planets in Space Engineers by adding randomly generated stations like defense and observation posts with which you can interact.

It's quite a fun mod if you start getting sick of how desolate all of the planets seem.

### Ship AI Voice Basic

[Ship AI Voice Basic](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=430267269){: target="\_blank"} adds a bunch of unique voice lines to Space Engineers, making the worlds feel less lonely.

In this awesome mod, you can have your ship equipped with an AI of sorts that reacts to all of the things you do.

### Exploration Enhancement

Lastly, the [Exploration Enhancement mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531659576){: target="\_blank"} is a massive overhaul for Space Engineers that introduces tons of new mechanics to the game.

It feeds the roleplayer in all of us, adding things like trade, militaries, authorities, and many more factions to interact with. You have to play it to believe it.

## Modded Server Support

Most server hosts provide a smooth modding experience via automatic installs with the click of a button, while others give you direct FTP file access to connect your mods.

Either way, you can have some serious fun with modding your Space Engineers server.

Host Havoc and VeryGames explicitly offer easy mod installation and support for Space Engineers, while PingPerfect advertises their FTP access.

## How to Choose a Host

Unlike many other multiplayer games, Space Engineers doesn't seem like it was designed for massive multiplayer. Maybe just you and a couple of friends.

This design flaw can make choosing much more difficult, in the sense that almost every host is providing the same type of service instead of massively multiplayer versus small player slot servers.

If you're playing with people across the country or farther, then you should go for the fastest on our list. That way, you won't have any connection issues, de-syncing, rubber banding, etc.

However, if you're simply playing locally, then choose a cheaper server with locations closer to you so both you and your crew can connect and play without much issue or opt for a close server with a wide range of features.

For a full explanation on choosing the [best server hosting company](/game-hosts/), check out our guide!

## Space Engineers Multiplayer

As we just mentioned, [Space Engineers multiplayer](https://www.spaceengineerswiki.com/Multiplayer){: target="\_blank"} isn't like Minecraft, where you have tens or hundreds of people connecting to one server to play in an ever-changing world.

When you load up a Space Engineers server, you're venturing into the unknown with a small band of merry men (or women) on a journey to build to the limits of the universe and create massive, awe-inspiring inter-galactic structures to showcase your brilliance.

## How to Host a Free Space Engineers Server

<div class="vid-container">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwCXhqtDNeM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Now, while Space Engineers already has a co-op feature in place so that players can directly connect and play together, you've gotta ask, "what if I wanna play while my friend is offline?"

That's where dedicated, third-party servers come in. Just like other games, you can pay for a dedicated server with one of the hosts we listed above, but there's always the option to host your server locally for absolutely free.

Again, the Space Engineers come in to save the day, offering an effortless setup for making a dedicated server through Steam. However, you do still need to do some port forwarding on your router to have out-of-network player connections.

Regardless, the dev team has a full walkthrough for dedicated server setup [here](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/dedicated-servers.html){: target=" \_blank"}.

## Is Space Engineers Cross-Platform?

Unfortunately, Space Engineers is not cross-platform, nor does the dev team plan to introduce any cross-play features following the official release of Space Engineers on Xbox One.

## How Do You Make a Space Engineers Server Private?

Making your Space Engineers server private is relatively easy.

On dedicated servers it's as simple as this:

**1.** Make sure your server is off.

**2.** Create a Steam Group and add the players that you want to have access

**3.** Find your configuration files and add the Steam Group ID to the Dedicated Easy Configurator file

And just like that, you've got a private server!

With server hosts, on the other hand, for some hosts that offer FTP access, you can repeat those same steps, while other hosts may have private server options upon purchase.

## What Port Does Space Engineers Use?

If you want to host a dedicated server and invite your friends from outside your network, you'll need to do a process called port forwarding on your router, which allows players to connect from outside sources.

When port forwarding, you need the specific port dedicated to the game you're hosting a server for.

In Space Engineers' case, the port is 27016.

{% include games.html %}

## Conclusion

While Space Engineers might take a little work and know-how to get into enjoying, the payoff is worth it for sure. Nothing beats building a spaceship yourself to explore the Galaxy with your buddies and maybe fighting some pirates and stuff with mods.

Dedicated servers are an excellent route for Space Engineers because of the cost-saving and very low upkeep and resource draw, but purchasing a server host can still be viable in case you don't want players connecting through to your network.

Plus, with paid servers, you can get all of the power you'll ever need to host 10, 30, 50 concurrent players in Space Engineers. Imagine how amazing of an experience that would be!

Whichever way you go, there's always an option for you, and in the end, aren't we all just here to have fun?
