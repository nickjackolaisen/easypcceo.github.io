Here's the deal:

You're looking for Squad server hosting. Right on bro.

I'm going to skip the BS introduction and get down to business, so you can get back to the battlefield where you belong.

In this article, we're talking about the best Squad server hosting companies on the market.

I've been hosting Squad servers for several years now, and have tried many different companies, most of which sucked.

To save you the frustration and waste of money I had to deal with, here are the best options in terms of speed, support, and price to performance:

## About Squad

<img class="lazyload" alt="squad" data-src="/img/game-hosts/squad/game.jpg">

If you somehow managed to make it to this article without learning about Squad, here's a chance to enlighten yourself.

Squad is an online multiplayer shooter that's goal is to bridge the gap between full-on military simulator games such as the Arma series and run & gun arcade shooters like Call of Duty. In Squad, you work as a team, each person with their role, towards an objective or enemy, and you get punished for working alone.

Now that you're up to speed, wouldn't you love to participate in something like a 10v10, 20v20, hell a 40v40 military battle on your server where you make the rules? You can set the parameters, and you can decide the location, you can build your world.

So, what are some of the best server hosts you can use to get a perfect Squad server up and running for you and your community?

## How We Picked

We picked the best server hosts for you based on total cost, performance, price to performance, customer support, and prior server host experience with other games.

Each host has its strengths, so we urge you to choose based on the categories and what you think you need. For example, if you plan on hosting full clans of players ready to go at it 24/7, then maybe don't get the budget option, and if you only have a couple of friends and wanna fight each other, then you probably should go with a cheaper server based around slot prices.

## Best Squad Server Hosting Companies

Here are the best Squad server hosting companies on the market:

{% include ping-perfect.html %}

[PingPerfect](https://pingperfect.com/aff.php?aff=803){: target="\_blank"} is one of the best server hosting companies around, regardless of the game you're playing. Between their fair pricing, stellar support, great performance, and awesome control panel, it doesn't get better than them.

PingPerfect offers Squad server hosting starting at $0.95/slot. Their Squad servers have a minimum slot count of 20 and a maximum of 72. Considering most large scale Squad games are 40v40, it does seem a bit odd that they don't have a max slot count of 80, but oh well.

On top of choosing your slot count, you can pay for extra CPU priority, which is great for Squad server hosting since the games have a lot of players (which use a lot of CPU power).

</div>

{% include streamline-servers.html %}

Now, if speed is your need, then maybe you wanna try something like [Streamline Servers](https://streamline-servers.com/billing/aff.php?aff=974){: target="\_blank"}.

Out of all of our picks, they're the most expensive Squad hosting, but hey, you get what you pay for, don't you?

Streamline Servers live up to their name, offering a very streamlined and straightforward control panel for your server, alongside speedy connections and a reasonably large number of global server locations.

Squad fans - like all gamers - hate to lag. That's why choosing fast server hosting is especially important for Squad. Since most Squad battles have tons of players, you need a fast server host that can handle 20, 40, and even 80 players in one game.

Streamline Servers offers Squad hosting with a minimum of 20 slots and a maximum of 100 slots, from $1.25 per slot. 100 slots is pretty large for Squad hosting when compared to other hosts.

If you plan on hosting large scale battles and you want top-tier performance, Streamline Servers is the Squad server provider for you.

{% include citadel-servers.html %}

If you want cheap, we've got you there too. With Squad servers coming in at $0.43 per slot, [Citadel Servers](https://citadelservers.com/client/aff.php?aff=379){: target="\_blank"}, makes it easy to get a Squad server set up on the low.

With this kind of price, don't expect the best possible performance or variation in configuration options, but they do offer quite a bit for the price. Like other hosts, they have extensive payment plan options from monthly to annually, and each payment plan past monthly provides a discount.

The server locations are quite limited, but they offer paid performance increases, premium support plans, dedicated server hosting, and a dedicated IP option.

## How to Choose Squad Server Hosting

<img class="lazyload" alt="squad" data-src="/img/game-hosts/squad/logo.png">

Like we mentioned earlier in the first couple of sections, you need to choose a server based on what you plan to do with it. It may not seem all that important, but in the long term, it could mean the difference between $10 per month and $50 per month.

### I Have a Large Clan or Community

The higher the number of people you wish to host on your server simultaneously, you're going to need tons of slots and, more importantly, more processing power.

Hosts that allow you to get the most power out of the hosting server are going to give you the best experience with large numbers of people. If you've ever experienced bad connections or rubberbanding, that's how it'll feel with tons of people on a low power server.

### I Have Like 20 Friends I Wanna Play Squad With

On the other end of the spectrum, some servers focus on low power, low cost, minimal player servers for the people who want a little miniature battle.

Budget servers are the best option for low headcount servers. Servers that charge by the slot are ideal, but you should compare prices to get your money's worth.

## Dedicated vs Shared Squad Hosting

<img class="lazyload" alt="dedicated vs shared squad hosting" data-src="/img/game-hosts/squad/dedicated-vs-shared.jpg">

There are two simple designations of hosting for squad servers and often other types of game server hosting.

### Shared

Shared hosting is mostly standard amongst website hosts, though many game hosting companies offer shared game hosting as well. When you choose a shared hosting service, it's kind of like buying bargain bin stuff.

You get what you pay for in terms of performance. On a shared server, there are multiple Squad servers hosted off of the same resources, and thus each server has to share processing power and internet bandwidth.

### Dedicated

Dedicated is going to cost you a bit more than sharing on any hosting site because of the extra performance it can provide.

A dedicated server is essentially when the host has a server dedicated to hosting only your game. All resources are solely allocated to hosting your server, so you don't have to share bandwidth and processing power like with shared hosting.

## How Much Does it Cost to Host a Squad Server?

Squad server hosting can cost you, on average, anywhere between $10(USD) per month to $30 per month. However, that price can dramatically drop if you need a small number of slots, as there are hosts who charge under a dollar per slot.

As we've said before (and we'll say again), you get what you pay for, at least most of the time. Don't go paying more than you need to, but don't employ a budget solution and expect anything close to world-class performance. Those people do exist.

All in all, compare prices to match your needs to get the most for your dollar when server shopping.

## What are the Game Modes in Squad?

Here is a list of the game modes in Squad:

- Advance and Secure
- Random Advance and Secure
- Skirmish
- Destruction
- Insurgency
- Invasion
- Territory Control
- Shooting Range (Single player sandbox for training and practice)

## How Much Does it Cost to Rent a Game Server?

Renting a game server can range anywhere from $10 per month to $150 per month, depending on the size of your server, the game you're playing, and you're hosting company.

Keep in mind, you get what you pay for. More players and larger maps usually means higher prices, and since Squad is such a large scale multiplayer game, Squad server hosting is usually on the expensive side.

## How to Host Your Squad Server (Free)

Alright, so, while you can host a Squad server for completely free of your home computer or separate computer on your network, it's really not a good idea.

First of all, the sheer processing power and system memory you would need to run an online game like Squad is a lot more than games like [Rust](/game-hosts/rust/), [Ark](/game-hosts/ark/), or Minecraft. Squad is designed for large simultaneous player counts, and it isn't cost-effective to host it from home.

On the same note, having large numbers of players connecting to a server on your home network isn't going to serve for a great gaming experience for you nor anybody else playing on the server.

## Final Word

Squad is an awesome game that's better played with friends.

Playing the game is the fun part - finding good Squad server hosting providers, on the other hand, is challenging.

But the importance of choosing a good host cannot be overstated. Hopefully this article helped you choose the best provider for your next Squad server!
