Here's the deal:

Most people build with standard PC cases, but inverted PC cases are pretty darn cool too. And hey, why not be a bit different?

If you want to put your PC on the left side of your setup, or for some reason want to build your PC entirely upside down, I've compiled the 3 best inverted PC cases on the market today for every budget.

Let's dive in:

## What is an Inverted PC Case?

Standard PC cases have a left side panel window, and a vertical motherboard configuration where the GPU is mounted horizontally, below the CPU socket.

Conversely, an inverted PC case has its motherboard mounted so that the GPU is on top and the CPU is on bottom.

<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrD0EUOJqA8">PC Centric</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

In addition, inverted PC cases have their side panel window on the right side instead of the left.

If you only have enough desk space to put your PC on the left side of your monitor, having a side panel window on the left side of your case isn't going to do you much good. You won't be able to see your components, effectively wasting the whole point of having a window in the first place.

That's where an inverted PC case comes in. Inverted PC cases have a right side panel window so you can see your components even when your PC is on your left.

In addition, motherboards are typically installed backwards in an inverted PC case, meaning the GPU lives at the top of the case, above the CPU.

The Base 801 from Be Quiet! is unique in that you can build a standard PC with the motherboard right side up - or, you can easily modify it, turning it into an inverted PC case with an upside down motherboard and a right side panel window.

What's awesome about this case is the terrific engineering - think about all of the work and planning that goes into designing a normal case, and now consider the extra planning it takes to ensure everything fits with an inverse configuration.

If you're looking for the best inverted PC case on the market, I'd highly recommend the Silent Base 801. It's the perfect combination of looks, functionality, and price.

Sleek lines and a crap load of glass make for an incredibly good looking case. But this one has its internal components visible from the right side of the case instead of the left.

The SilverSTone LD01 has a lot of tempered glass, dark tinted with a stainless steel frame. The top of the case has a vent with a removable magnetic filter, and the bottom has another dust filter that protects the power supply fan.

If you like a lot of glass (a modern design in my opinion) then the LD01 is for you.

In recent years, Thermaltake has produced many cases that are largely popular, especially their Core series. The Thermaltake Core G3 is no exception, offering a stylish full sized form factor without being too big and bulky.

It's also one of the cheaper cases on this list, so you could use it if you're building a cheap gaming PC.

## Why Buy an Inverted PC Case?

<div class="quote-box">
  <p>There are only three reasons (at least that I can think of) you want to build your PC with an inverted case. Either you have limited desk space, you think it'll improve cooling performance, or you're just one of those guys that always has to be different.</p>
    <div class="quote-ref">
      <img src="/img/profile/close.jpg">
      <a href="/about/">Jacob Tuwiner</a>
      <span class="position">Founder, Easy PC</span>
    </div>
</div>

Let's talk about each one:

### Desk Space Limitations

This is the most common reason why people build with inverted PC cases, and it's also the most understandable.

For some reason a lot of PC case manufacturers have opted to put their side panel windows on the left side panel, assuming everyone wants to put their PC on the right side of their setup.

But if you have limited desk space and plan on putting your PC on the left side of your setup, having an inverted PC case with a right side panel window is important. At least, it is if you want to see your components.

### You Want to Be Different

Maybe you can put your case on the right side of your build, but you want to be unique. Not everyone has an inverted case - in fact, most people don't. Building your PC upside down in an inverted PC case is sure to attract the attention of anyone who steps in the room.

Alright, maybe not your girlfriend's attention - but anyone who builds PCs will surely notice and appreciate the change of pace.

### You Want Better Cooling Performance

The last reason why you might want an inverted PC case is because you think it'll have better [cooling performance](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/128313-extremetechs-guide-to-air-cooling-your-pc){: target="\_blank"} than a traditional case.

Let me explain:

Heat rises, and if you have your GPU on top, the heat should rise easily to the top case fans without any obstructions, which is not the case with a traditional setup.

While that makes sense in theory, you probably won't experience any noticeable performance difference in the real world.

With so many other factors at play, the configuration of your motherboard in a traditional or inverted fashion probably won't have a noticeable impact on cooling.

## Be Quiet! Silent Base 801

The side panels are incredibly easy to remove with possibly the best design I've ever seen - simply push a button on the back and it pops right off.

<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="silent base side panels" src="/img/cases/inverted/dark-base/push-button.png" >
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aq7We-xxY4">TechteamGB</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

But that's not all about this case I love - the entire thing is modular, meaning you can adjust, move and rearrange everything. Like I said, you can essentially invert the entire thing.

<img class="lazyload" alt="dark base modularity" src="/img/cases/inverted/dark-base/modular.png" >

The Dark Base Pro 801 also features an insanely thick sound dampening pad on the back of the side panel (figures, it is a Be Quiet! product…)

The case does a terrific job at dampening case fan noise, but this could be at the cost of cooling performance.

<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="silent base foam" src="/img/cases/inverted/dark-base/foam.png" >
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aq7We-xxY4">TechteamGB</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

For starters, the entire front panel is exactly that, a solid front panel with only two slits on either side for airflow. Granted, they're wide and run the entire height of the case, but probably aren't as great for cooling performance as other cases with a more open design.

<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="silent base 801 front" src="/img/cases/inverted/dark-base/front.png" >
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aq7We-xxY4">TechteamGB</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

Overall the case has loads of hard drive storage, and a spacious interior fit for standard ATX motherboards and below. It's a bit odd that it can't fit larger motherboards given the size of the case (it's pretty big and heavy).

But oh well, most of you are probably going to use ATX or Micro ATX anyway, both of which this inverted PC case can support.

The case has a few SSD drives behind the motherboard tray which are fully removable if you don't want them there, which is pretty sweet. Again, the modularity of this case is spectacular.

On top you'll find the IO panel with USB 3.0 ports, the power switch, reset switch, hard drive activity LED, standard audio jacks, and a three speed fan controller (no software needed!)

<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="silent base 801 top IO panel" src="/img/cases/inverted/dark-base/controller.png" >
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aq7We-xxY4">TechteamGB</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

The overall design of the case is nothing short of impressive, and despite not having crazy LED lighting, the subtle look with nice orange accents is, in my opinion, terrific.

I'm starting to grow tired of every case screaming for attention with crazy RGBs, and prefer cases that look nice without caring too much about it.

In conclusion, if you want a premium inverted PC case that you can configure in every which way, the Silent Base 801 from Be Quiet! is my top pick.

## SilverStone LD01

Although it only supports micro ATX motherboards its size makes it seem like a standard mid tower case.

And like the other cases on our list, the motherboard is mounted upside down, leaving the graphics card near the top of the case and the CPU cooler towards the bottom.

The LD01 has a large vent on top of the case which the GPU can use to pull cool air, which should have a positive impact on cooling performance.

<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="silverstone LD01 top panel" src="/img/cases/inverted/ld01/top-vent.png" >
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytRxjrjC2QQ">ponchato</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

In terms of storage space, there is a three drive hard drive bay in the power supply shroud which can be moved to three different locations, in case you need some extra space down there for a power supply or a front radiator.

Each drive bay is adjustable and can house either 3.5" HDD drives or 2.5" SSDs.

There are also two additional 2.5" mounting options behind the motherboard tray for traditional SSDs.

<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="silverstone LD01 storage drives" src="/img/cases/inverted/ld01/drives.png" >
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytRxjrjC2QQ">ponchato</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

Here are the case's maximum sizes:

- CPU coolers up to 168mm
- GPU up to 370mm
- PSUs up to 160mm (or 220mm with the drive bays all the way forward)

With that in mind, if you're going to mount a front radiator on this case I'd suggest a 140mm or 150mm power supply to make your life _way_ easier.

One of the case's main drawbacks (aside from somewhat limited drive storage) is that the LD01 doesn't ship with any stock fans.

It can fit two 120mm or 140mm fans in the front, and one on top. It can also fit a 120mm fan on the rear, and has support for up to 280mm radiators on the front and top.

SilverStone did come through with the dust filters though, because they fully cover the fans without leaving any room for dust to get sucked in. [Cable management](https://www.pcgamer.com/cable-management-101-how-to-control-cable-chaos-outside-your-pc/){: target="\_blank"} in this case is a breeze - three grommets next to the motherboard tray make it easy to run your cables, and there's sufficient space between the motherboard tray and the back left panel to hide your cables.

Cable management doesn't actually impact your airflow, but it definitely affects the look of your build. And if you're buying an inverted case just to see your components, they ought to look good.

There are even pre-existing cable ties to help you keep things nice and tidy - overall, building in this PC is quite easy, considering the spacious interior and easy cable management.

## Thermaltake Core G3

Somehow this case can house a full sized ATX motherboard despite how slim it is.

One of the cool things about this inverted PC case is that it can be stood up like a regular tower, or laid down on its side to put under your TV.

They've managed to cram a full ATX motherboard inside of a case that's not particularly large. The G3's width is easily its smallest dimension (140mm), which is why it made it on [our list of small and slim ATX cases](/pc-cases/smallest-atx-cases/).

For those of you who want a slim inverted PC case with a right side panel window and you don't have a huge budget, this is the case for you.

One of the main drawbacks of the G3 is it can only fit a low profile CPU cooler of no more than 110mm, which is quite small.

But once you get past that, it's surprisingly fully featured. You can put a liquid cooler on the front or the roof without much trouble, and it has pretty good airflow.

Since it's an inverted case (like the rest on this list) the motherboard is upside down and the acrylic side panel window is on the right side. You can stand the PC upright on the left side of your desk and see the internals, or lay it down like a horizontal PC case and use it underneath your TV or monitor.

One of the keys to this case's ability to get away with such a slim profile is the fact that it can only support an SFX power supply, not a full ATX power supply.

The case also makes use of a vertical GPU mount which is pretty cool, and comes with a riser cable so you don't have to worry about that.

What's the bottom line here?

The Thermaltake Core G3 is a slim ATX case with a right side panel window and an inverted configuration. It can't support big graphics cards or tall CPU coolers, but if you're looking for a basic inverted PC case on a budget, this is our top pick.

## Is an Inverted PC Case Worth It?

There is no right or wrong answer to this question - it all depends on your specific situation.

Choosing a PC case is hard enough, and throwing inverted configurations into the mix isn't making things easier. If you want to learn more about [how to choose a PC case](/pc-cases/), click that link to check out our complete guide.

Anyway, for the most part there isn't a tangible difference between a standard and inverted PC case that I can see. Theoretically it might have better cooling performance, but in the real world that's not the case.

All in all the only real difference is the aesthetic look of the case. I'd say an inverted PC case is worth it if you want to place your case on the left side of your desk, or you want to make your build stand out in an upside down configuration.

This is, of course, assuming you have the budget to spend on an inverted PC case. If you're trying to build a [budget gaming PC](/budget-pcs/) you should allocate most of your money to the CPU and GPU, not the case.

Although this video is a few years old and the 600C is no longer on the market, it does a great job talking about inverted PC cases in general:
