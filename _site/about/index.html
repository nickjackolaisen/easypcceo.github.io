    <h2 id="jacob-tuwiner---owner--founder">Jacob Tuwiner - Owner &amp; Founder</h2>

<p>My name is <a href="https://www.jacobtuwiner.com/">Jacob Tuwiner</a>. I’m the owner and creator of Easy PC, a site designed to help the new guy in the computer space. Whether you want to build your first gaming PC or your first cryptocurrency mining rig, I’ve got you covered.</p>

<p>I used to be a console gamer from age 9, until I played on my friend’s gaming PC for the first time. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw Battlefield 4 in true 1080p resolution with ultra settings, 60 FPS. I also loved raiding someone’s base in Rust which is still my favorite game to this day! From that moment on I knew I had to build a gaming PC.</p>

<p><img src="/img/profile/headshot.png" alt="ME" class="circle img-right img-small" /></p>

<p>I used some of my bar mitzvah money to build my first gaming PC. I researched which components would best fit my budget and watched tons of videos on YouTube about PC building.</p>

<p>Then the day arrived. All of my parts finally came in the mail and I assembled my first PC.</p>

<p>Then I turned it on. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>I checked everything and tried again. Nothing.</p>

<p>Then I looked two more times and realized I made a novice mistake. I didn’t connect the CPU power cable!</p>

<p>I turned it on again. Bam! Everything was working properly. From that moment on I was a member of the PC gaming community.</p>

<p>I first made the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPW6x4ZBXR06cjmf1wOS2g" target="_blank">Easy PC YouTube channel</a> and eventually this website in order to help those just starting out. Trust me, it’s a lot easier than it seems! The hardest part is getting started, and it’s all down hill from there.</p>

<p>Here are some of the PC gaming and technology websites I’ve contributed to:</p>

<h3 id="my-experience-building-computers">My Experience Building Computers</h3>

<p>I’ve been building computers for more than 8 years now (I started when I was 12 years old). I used to tear down my PC every week and put it back together for fun (yeah, I had no life).</p>

<p>Now I can configure a PC in less than 30 minutes, blind folded with my hands behind my back. Okay, not really, but I can build a PC in just about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I’m always looking at the latest hardware deals and staying up to date with the newest PC hardware.</p>

<p>With more than 8 years of PC building experience under my belt and many more to come, I’ve created Easy PC to share my expertise with people like you!</p>

<h3 id="my-current-pc-specs">My Current PC Specs</h3>

<p>If you’re curious about what I’m running in my rig, I’m going to list my specs down below.</p>

<p>I don’t really feel the need to run my games in 1440p or 4K resolution. I’d rather save the money and play in 1080p with medium-high settings with 60+ FPS. That being said, here are my specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Ryzen 3 1200 Overclocked to 4.0 GHz</li>
  <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASRock AB350M</li>
  <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 2x4GB DDR4 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 240 GB SSD, 120GB SSD, 1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics Card:</strong> GeForce GTX 1060 3GB</li>
  <li><strong>Case</strong>: NZXT Phantom with Blue LEDs</li>
  <li><strong>PSU:</strong> Corsair 500 Watt Power Supply</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not the most expensive build in the world, but it definitely suits my purposes well.</p>

<h2 id="jordyn-hamilton---editor-in-chief">Jordyn Hamilton - Editor in Chief</h2>
<p><img src="/img/profile/jordyn.jpg" alt="Jordyn" class="circle img-right img-small" /></p>

<p>The Man? The Myth? The Legend?</p>

<p>Hey there! I’m Jordyn Hamilton, a writer and editor for Easy PC. The one-stop-shop for brand new PC builders, gamers, and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<p>I got my start in the PC community around 2017 when a good friend of mine convinced me to build a gaming computer after he’d done the same. I had always thought about getting into PC gaming since the most I’d experienced up to that point was 30fps Minecraft on my old HP laptop.</p>

<p>So the concept of running any games at a good framerate, and for a good price, was gorgeous to me. Around that time, I got a job editing for an online blog. I made around $1,400 working on it and I threw about $500 of that into my brand new PC build.</p>

<p>Mind you, I did not know anything about computers prior to this and I did not seek out any help in choosing parts (like I should have). In the end, my first build looked a little something like: FX 6300, RX 560 4GB, random $10 aftermarket CPU cooler, just to name a few hiccups.</p>

<p>That build served me well for a couple of months until I got bored with it and wanted to upgrade. What I did was sell the parts for a little less than I paid, then I used the money to buy more used parts so I could build two more computers. Then I sold those and repeated the process until I had around $1,000.</p>

<p>Fast forward to February 2018. At this point component prices were horrible but I want my PC now, so I charged in full of zeal with $1,000 to build the best I could, and that build fuels me to this day. Though, at this point, I think I’ve sunk another $100 or so into it.</p>

<h3 id="my-current-pc-specs-1">My Current PC Specs</h3>

<p>While my rig isn’t the greatest by any means, it’s what I could get at the time with the knowledge I had at the time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Ryzen 5 2600 Overclocked to 4.05GHz</li>
  <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> MSI B350 PC MATE</li>
  <li><strong>RAM:</strong> PNY Anarchy 2x8GB 2400MHz Overclocked to 3133MHz</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2TB 7200RPM HDD, 500GB 7200RPM HDD, 240GB SATA SSD, 32GB M.2 SSD</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics Card:</strong> GeForce GTX 980 G1 Gaming</li>
  <li><strong>Case</strong>: DIYPC VisionII-Bl Black</li>
  <li><strong>PSU:</strong> Corsair RM650x 650W PSU</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diego-riitano---writer">Diego Riitano - Writer</h2>
<p><img class="lazyload circle img-right img-small" alt="diego riitano" data-src="/img/profile/diego.jpg" /></p>

<p>My name is Diego Riitano. I am a writer and editor here at Easy PC. I enjoy creating PC and gaming content that’s easy for a newcomer to understand.</p>

<p>I entered the PC world for the first time the summer before my freshman year of high school. I remember playing games on my cheap laptop and being unsatisfied with the low frame rates and disappointed graphics.</p>

<p>After doing some research, I realized the best way to get the performance I wanted was to pick my own components and build a PC myself.</p>

<p>I was very intimidated at the prospect of building my own computer, but after seeing many guides online, I thought I should make the leap.</p>

<p>After multiple weeks of researching the best components, I was finally ready to order. The day my parts arrived I was incredibly excited to finally build it. Being a total novice, it took me around 3 hours to get it all together.</p>

<p>Taking it slow and steady, I managed to get my PC built without any major problems. When it finally booted up, I was ecstatic to start playing games. Finally I could play AAA titles with max settings and still get a buttery smooth 60+ FPS.</p>

<p>For the past 6 years since then, I’ve been building computers and learning more about gaming and PCs every day. I like to help those new to the scene since I remember exactly how I felt when I built my first PC.</p>

<p>My Current PC Specs:</p>

<p>Nowadays, my rig isn’t the most powerful, but it definitely suits my purposes well. As long as I can play most games at 1080p with respectable frame rates, I’m satisfied.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU: Intel i7-4790K</li>
  <li>Motherboard: MSI Z97 PC Mate</li>
  <li>RAM: 4x4GB DDR3 1600 MHz</li>
  <li>Storage: 240 GB SSD, 480 GB SSD</li>
  <li>Graphics Card: Radeon R9 290 4 GB</li>
  <li>Case: Sentey Burton Plus 3.0 GS-6510</li>
  <li>PSU: Antec HCG-850M 850 Watt Bronze Plus</li>
